# yumfetch

An open-source program for displaying computer specs in fashion.
Very unfinished and will be improved.

# Config Usage

The Config file contains settings changing certain pc specs being shown, and the ascii txt file you want to use.

To remove a certain computer spec from being shown, simply change the true from false from the spec you want removed.
You can change the order the specs should be shown in aswell.

In AsciiArt, It contains ascii art to display on the fetch.
Make a txt file with any name, go to the config file and change the ascii value to the name of the txt file.

# Getting the packages
